Dear Manoj, 

Please accept this letter of resignation, effectively from  24th September, 2019. 

I have accepted a position with another company that will further my growth and development in my career. 

This was not an easy decision, because I am grateful for the appreciated and rewarding employment I've had with Freshworks. But after days of pondering and consideration, I have taken this leap. 

I appreciate the professional development and growth from Freshworks, and in particular, from you. Your mentoring support has encouraged me, and I hope that we will continue our relationship as I move forward in my career. 

If I can be of any assistance during this transition in order to facilitate the seamless passing of my responsibilities to my successor, please let me know. I would be glad to help however I can.
